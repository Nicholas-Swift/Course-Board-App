# TODO:
 * Need to differentiate products and courses view
 * Add ability to edit courses if you are instructor/user
 * Need to Polish UI
  * Add a list at the top for example courses: Objectives, descriptions, Participants
  * Instead of edit button, possibly put it on where the tab bar would be
  * Change edit button to scroll out for participants
  * Get rid of tab bar while inside of course/product

#Other:
 * Mastery tracking
 * Instructor Dashboard

# Issues:
 * Need to make sure app will not crash if loses connection to internet
 * Edge cases
